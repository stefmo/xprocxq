#summary Overview of planned features and where xprocxq is going.

= Planned Features =

* Tighter eXist integration *: next version will have tighter integration with eXist in that xprocxq will get built and included automatically via the build process

*XProc Standard Step Compliance*: tba

*XProc Multi Container Step Compliance*: tba

*W3C XProc Unit Test results*: I have developed an extension step to run xprocxq against the [http://tests.xproc.org W3C XProc Unit Test suite]. It works but needs a bit of attention before I release both the extension step and the test results ... hoping a few more days will result in significantly higher complaince with the spec.

*compile XProc to XQuery*: The way xprocxq has been created its relatively easy to generate an XQuery code listing which can run (with xprocxq modules).

= Roadmap =

  * release eXist version ('throw it over the wall')
  * implement as many of the standard & optional steps as possible
  * refactor handling of sequences, weak typing and replace preparse routine
  * ensure static and dynamic error checking is working properly and try to beautify
  and add useful things like line numbers where error occurred 
  * integrate namespace handling module to implement more sophisticated namespace fixup 
  * consider porting to other XQuery processors
