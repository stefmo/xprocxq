= Unit Tests Overview =

There are 2 types of unit tests used for xproc.xq

  * XQuery unit tests: These test xquery code base themselves using my homegrown XQuery Unit Testing Suite [http://xprocxq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/main/test/xquery/test.xqm test.xqm]

  * XProc functional tests: These run xproc.xq against a couple of sets of actual XProc XML Pipelines

All unit tests are controlled by Apache Ant ... I could have just as well used make or something else; the thinking here is that most of the XQuery processors of interest are written in Java.

_Note: The XProc functional tests are further split into my own basic tests and I have started an area of unit tests which are converted into Norman Walsh's XProc TestSuite format._
