p:xpath-context is currently not working

p:when tests need to use `.//` instead of `//` for paths or `./` for `/`. This is related to how eXist represents root document internally and should be addressed soon.

p:choose step requires that all the branches should have the equiv output which is currently a little strange in xprocxq ... means you need to explicitly binding to result port for the step to use output.
