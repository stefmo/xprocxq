= Right Now =

3/12/2007 I am just about ready to commit the bulk of v.5 which represents the first version of xproc.xq that 'does stuff. Perhaps in time to announce whilst XML 2007 is running ;)


= Limitations =

There are so many to list .... so I will just list the major ones

* very limited std step library

* must explicitly define input connections

* no command line entry point

* have yet to remove dependency with Saxon-SA (though our targets are Saxon-B and eXist)
