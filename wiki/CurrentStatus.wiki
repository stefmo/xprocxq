= Current Status =

22/11/2008  working out some very tricky and deep bugs, just got through a 2 week bug hunt, I hope this means a release is soon

= Changelog =

Check out the [http://xprocxq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/main/ChangeLog Changelog] included in the source code. This file is  not always up to date in trunk but will reflect reality for tag releases.


= ISSUES/TODO =

The project [http://code.google.com/p/xprocxq/issues/list issue tracker] is the best place to find this information.


= Limitations and Issues=

There are many issues to list .... so I will just highlight the major ones;

  * sequences inconsistent

  * depends on one having bought Michael Kay's [http://www.saxonica.com Saxon-SA]  XSLT/XQUERY processor ... as dependent on SA version and even then it does very little ;)

  * sync all error messages

  * working on subpipelines, imports and libraries and related issues such as precedence, etc

  * fixing non primary input/output handling


This example pipeline, using p:identity step

{{{
 <p:pipeline xmlns:p="http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc"
                name="pipeline">
  
  <p:identity name="test"/>

</p:pipeline>

}}}

would generate the following output (using test.xml)

{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

         <test>
            <a>test1</a>
            <b/>
            <c>
        I wish I was a fish
          <d/>
            </c>
         </test>

}}}

_Note: Looking at the current trunk/TODO file will help you determine what I am focusing on for now._

= When will you release and will xproc.xq be compliant ? =

If I had a road map it would be;

  * update testsuite
  * implement all standard steps
  * implement optional & extension steps
  * ensure static and dynamic error checking is working properly
  * check namespace fixup works as outlined in spec
  * create code fork to derive eXist and Saxon impl

I will need to get each of the above nearer 100% before I release.
