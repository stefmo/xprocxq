#summary Describes current 'state of play' with xproc.xq

= Status =

17/08/2008 working off latest editor spec ... aiming for a release Sept 6th.

= Changelog =

Check out the [http://xprocxq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/main/ChangeLog Changelog] included in the source code. This file is  not always up to date in trunk but will reflect reality for tag releases.


= TODO =

The source code [http://xprocxq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/main/TODO TODO] file is the best place to find this information.


= Limitations and Issues=

There are so many issues to list .... so I will just highlight the major ones;

  * depends on one having bought Michael Kay's [http://www.saxonica.com Saxon-SA]  XSLT/XQUERY processor ... as dependent on SA version and even then it does very little ;)

  * planned release version will support both eXist and SAXON

  * its best to explicitly define input connections in XProc XML

  * no command line entry point .. all operation is via Ant script, which just means running unit tests

_Note: Looking at the current trunk/TODO file will help you determine what I am focusing on for now._

= When will you release and will xproc.xq be compliant ? =

If I had a road map it would be;

  * update testsuite (10% done)
  * do standard steps implementations (50% done)
  * do optional & extension steps implementations (50% done)
  * ensure static and dynamic error checking is working properly (40% done)
  * ensure namespaces are fixed up properly (20% done)
  * build process to derive eXist and Saxon impl from same codebase (20% done)

I will need to get each of the above near 100% before I release.

I believe that I will partially satisfy XProc v1.0 compliance ... the choice of using XQuery restricts me somewhat in that I have to resort to extending the underlying XQUery processor. Here are the real problems;

  * Try/Catch mechanism
