#summary This page lists out current development status of xproc.xq

= Right Now =

I am just about ready to commit the bulk of v.5 which represents the first version of xproc.xq that 'does stuff.


= Limitations =

There are so many to list .... so I will just list the major ones


* very limited std step library

* must explicitly define input connections

* no command line entry point

* have yet to remove dependency with Saxon-SA (though our targets are Saxon-B and eXist)
