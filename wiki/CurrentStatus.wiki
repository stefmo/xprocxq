== Limitations and Issues ==

xprocxq, being implemented in XQuery, currently has several limitations and is no where compliant with the existing XProc draft specification.

As I originally developed using SAXON-SA, I have had to disable many of XProc steps as I port across but should have a good set of steps running somewhat soon.

Here is a list of the more severe limitations:

  * due to my use of weak typing in XQuery there are several interrelated issues, but this will change as I sanitize the code

  * little consistent support for sequences where you would expect them, once again I am addressing this as I work porting things across 

  * have disabled namespace management for the time being which applies XProc namespace fixup rules

  * defining reusable pipelines using p:library, p:import and p:declare-step is currently disabled 

  * errors are thrown as XQuery errors, making it difficult to reportcorrect line numbers, not to mention that errors themselves look quite ugly

  * p:choose xpath-context is not implemented just yet

  * in p:choose, need to use ./ convention in p:when (in p:choose) test attributes due to limitation in eXist util:eval function

  * some step sorting issues (intermixing of steps using p:inline), best to use explicit port binding to avoid.

  * p:xquery currently uses a c:result element to output, I also added a xproc:escape attribute to c:query to avoid having to wrap XQuery using CDATA (which is XProc spec requirement).

  * declare base-uri affects module imports (need to investigate across all XQuery processors)

  * cant pass required/add-attribute--002.xml test depends on namespace handling module to be finished

  * errors and/or p:error does not write to error port (also discussing need for a generic 'implementator specific error code' with XProc WG)

  * current preparsing routine is naive; I have a more rigorous solution in a source control branch to merge
