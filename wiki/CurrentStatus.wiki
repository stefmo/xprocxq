#summary Describes current 'state of play' with xproc.xq

= Status =

11/07/2008 working off May 1st spec ... passing many unit tests have about 15 steps implemented, but I would not recommend using codebase just yet, there are a lot of idiosyncrasies and I am pretty certain no one would be able to get the code running on their machine just yet ... should have a first release before 1st week of August.

= Changelog =

Check out the [http://xprocxq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/main/ChangeLog Changelog] included in the source code. This file is  not always up to date in trunk but will reflect reality for tag releases.


= TODO =

The source code [http://xprocxq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/main/TODO TODO] file is the best place to find this information.


= Limitations and Issues=

There are so many issues to list .... so I will just highlight the major ones;

  * currently a bit out of step with latest version of xproc draft .... this will change soon

  * depends on one having bought Michael Kay's [http://www.saxonica.com Saxon-SA]  XSLT/XQUERY processor ... as dependent on SA version and even then it does very little ;)

  * its best to explicitly define input connections in XProc XML

              <p:pipe step="step2" port="step2-output"/>
       </p:input>
    </p:count>

    <p:count name="step1">
        <p:input port="step1-input">
              <p:pipe step="helloworld" port="std-input"/>
        </p:input>
        <p:output port="step1-output"/>
    </p:count>

 </p:pipeline>

  * no command line entry point .. all operation is via Ant script, which just means running unit tests

_Note: Looking at the current trunk/TODO file will help you determine what I am focusing on for now._

= When will feature X be done or xproc.xq be compliant with W3C spec ? =

I have a desire to get xproc.xq to XProc v1.0 compliance, but using XQuery means I am  pragmatic on how realistic this goal is. There are all sorts of issues, some that have been surmounted, some I have yet to even engage with yet.

If I had a road map, in plan view it would be;

  * update testsuite
  * do standard steps implementations
  * do optional & extension steps implementations
  * ensure static and dynamic error checking is working properly
  * ensure namespaces are fixed up properly
  * build process to derive eXist and Saxon impl from same codebase
