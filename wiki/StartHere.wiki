= Getting xquery.xq =

So far I have not released any packaged version ... so your only method is checking out from subversion.


= Installation and Dependencies =

Most up to date definition of dependencies is contained in the source code [http://xprocxq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/main/README README]

Step 1: Generally, one needs an XQuery processor (Saxon-SA currently) to be run from the commandline. This XQuery processor needs to be supported by xproc.xq. 

Step 2: Will require [http://ant.apache.org Apache Ant] to run the build file tests.

Step 3: Run the saxon-compile Ant Target, to compile the small extension currently required for Saxon

Step 4: Amend your local [http://xprocxq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/main/properties.xml properties.xml] to reflect your setup and where your xquery jars are.

There is no specific build process as of yet with xproc.xq, though I may create an optimization process if support of a single XQuery is all that is needed.


= Running xproc.xq =

Since xproc.xq is still very experimental all one can really do is check out from source control and run the various Ant targets.





= What next =

Well, its all about play at the moment!

We are hoping that v1.0 will be a somewhat compliant deployment of the XProc specification ... though the limitations of XQuery as a programming language may stop us ;)
