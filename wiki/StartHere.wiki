= Getting xquery.xq =

So far I have not released any packaged version ... so your only method is checking out from subversion.


= Dependency =

Most up to date dependencies is contained in the source code [http://xprocxq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/main/README README]

Generally, one needs an XQuery processor (Saxon-SA currently) and Ant to run the build file tests.

= Setting up =

Since xproc.xq is still very experimental all one can really do is check out from source control and run the various Ant targets 

= What next =

well, its all about play at the moment ;)
