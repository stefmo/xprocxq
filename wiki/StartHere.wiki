= Getting xquery.xq =

So far I have not released any packaged version ... so your only method is checking out from [http://code.google.com/p/xprocxq/source subversion].


= Installation and Dependencies =

Most up to date definition of dependencies is contained in the source code [http://xprocxq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/main/README README]

*I*: Generally, one needs an XQuery processor (Saxon-SA currently) to be run from the commandline. This XQuery processor needs to be supported by xproc.xq. 

*II*: For now, one will require [http://ant.apache.org Apache Ant] to run unit tests and compile associated artifacts.

*III*: Run the saxon-compile Ant Target, to compile the small extension currently required for Saxon-SA

*IV*: Amend your local [http://xprocxq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/main/properties.xml properties.xml] to reflect your setup and where your xquery jars are.

It is not required to build xproc.xq itself, the Ant build is there for facilitating building of related extensions and running of unit tests

= Running xproc.xq =

Since xproc.xq is still very experimental all one can really do is check out from source control and run the various Ant targets.





= What next =

Well, its all about play at the moment!

I am hoping that v1.0 will be a somewhat compliant deployment of the XProc specification ... though the limitations of XQuery as a programming language may stop us ;)
