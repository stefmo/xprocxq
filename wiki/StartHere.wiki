#summary For those who want to install and play with xproc.xq

= Getting xquery.xq =

the only method of getting xproc.xq is checking it out from [http://code.google.com/p/xprocxq/source subversion].

{{{
# Non-members may svn check out a read-only working copy anonymously over HTTP.
svn checkout http://xprocxq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ xprocxq-read-only
}}}


= Installation and Dependencies =

The current definition of dependencies is contained in the source code [http://xprocxq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/main/README README] document.

*I*: install XQuery processor (only Saxon-SA currently supported, eXist XMLDB targeted as well).

*II*: You can use the Ant targets [http://ant.apache.org Apache Ant] to build java extension required by xprocxq and to run xquery and xproc unit tests.

*III*: Run the saxon-compile Ant Target, to compile the small extension currently required for Saxon-SA (or compile manually)

*IV*: Amend your local [http://xprocxq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/main/properties.xml properties.xml] to reflect your setup and where your Xquery processor jars are.

= Usage =

*warning:* xproc.xq is *Alpha* software at the moment.

It is not possible to run xproc.xq without SAXON-SA. 

There is a primitive script, bin/xprocxq which will run things from the commandline, though this script must be amended to reflect your local conditions ... mainly means adjusting the classpath env variable.

In addition, you can use Ant to run unit tests; run Apache Ant with -projecthelp switch to view options e.g. 

> ant -projecthelp

Here are the Main targets of interest:

 basic-xprocxq-test-suite    generates run script for xprocxq test xproc suite

 basic-calabash-test-suite   generates run script for calabash test xproc suite

 xproc-all                   run all significant xproc tests from Ant

 test-all-xquery             run all xquery unit tests
