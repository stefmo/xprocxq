#summary For those who want to install and play with xproc.xq

= Getting xquery.xq =

the only method of getting xproc.xq is checking it out from [http://code.google.com/p/xprocxq/source subversion].

{{{
# Non-members may svn check out a read-only working copy anonymously over HTTP.
svn checkout http://xprocxq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ xprocxq-read-only
}}}


= Installation and Dependencies =

The current definition of dependencies is contained in the source code [http://xprocxq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/main/README README] document.

*I*: install XQuery processor (only Saxon-SA currently supported, eXist XMLDB targeted as well).

*II*: You can use the Ant targets [http://ant.apache.org Apache Ant] to build java extension required by xprocxq and to run xquery and xproc unit tests.

*III*: Run the saxon-compile Ant Target, to compile the small extension currently required for Saxon-SA (or compile manually)

*IV*: Amend your local [http://xprocxq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/main/properties.xml properties.xml] to reflect your setup and where your Xquery processor jars are.

= Usage =

*warning:* xproc.xq is *Alpha* software at the moment.

In fact, it is not possible to run xproc.xq without SAXON-SA. There is now a primitive script, bin/xprocxq which will run things from the commandline, though this script may need to be amended to reflect your local conditions.

to get Ant targets, run Apache Ant with -projecthelp switch  

> ant -projecthelp

Here are the Main targets of interest:

 basic-xprocxq-test-suite    generates run script for xprocxq unit test suite

 basic-calabash-test-suite   generates run script for calabash unit test suite

 test-all-xquery             run all xquery tests

 xproc-all                   run all significant xproc tests
