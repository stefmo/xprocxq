# Running Unit tests #

Currently I use the custom XProc pipeline in test/test-runner.xml to run W3C draft XProc unit tests.

# Unit Tests Notes #

The XProc functional tests are split into my own basic tests and W3C draft XProc [Test Suite](http://tests.xproc.org/).

My own tests are in a constant state of flux and do not represent the current XProc draft. At some point I will be using only the W3C XProc unit tests
