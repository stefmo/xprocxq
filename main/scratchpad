* p:declare-step requires input/output port definition

* p:pipeline defines default input/output ports with sequence="false"

* need to define base uri of stdin and all external inputs for add-xml-base step

* dont have correct line numbers in error messages

* p:xquery currently uses c:result and has problems with some query formats

* If p:log or p:serialization elements appear in the declaration of an atomic step, they
will only be used if the atomic step is directly evaluated by the processor.
They have no effect if the step appears in a subpipeline; only the serialization options of
the “top level” step or pipeline are used because that is the only step which the processor
is required to serialize.

* need to correct xproc:default name in p:choose

* race condition when p:pipe calls a step that does not exist

* swap out xprocxq xproc tests with standard tests

* clean up xquery tests
