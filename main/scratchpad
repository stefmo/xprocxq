need to define top level input and output port on declare-step or its an error

need to determine base uri of stdin and all external inputs for add-xml-base step

dont have correct line numbers in error messages

p:xquery currently uses c:result and has problems with some query formats

If p:log or p:serialization elements appear in the declaration of an atomic step, they
will only be used if the atomic step is directly evaluated by the processor.
They have no effect if the step appears in a subpipeline; only the serialization options of
the “top level” step or pipeline are used because that is the only step which the processor
is required to serialize.


need to correct xproc:default name in p:choose

race condition when p:pipe calls a step that does not exist
