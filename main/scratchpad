REMINDERS
* empty stdin defaults to defined p:pipe,p:inline,p:document,p:data
* p:declare-step requires input/output port definition which needs binding from the outside
* p:pipeline defines default input/output ports with sequence="false"
* If p:log or p:serialization elements appear in the declaration of an atomic step, they
will only be used if the atomic step is directly evaluated by the processor.
They have no effect if the step appears in a subpipeline; only the serialization options of
the “top level” step or pipeline are used because that is the only step which the processor
is required to serialize.

ISSUES

* top level inputs (once bindings are in place most of this is fixed)
* namespace fixups
* sequences
* p:choose
* p:try in evalstep ?
