p:choose

* each subpipeline must have the same output signature

ISSUE
* declare-step needs refactoring
* components/multi-container steps needs refactoring (p:group,p:choose,p:for-each)
* inputs in nested p:declare-steps need fixing due to $allcomp in xproc:explicitnames
* namespace fixups: enumerate step level in scope namespaces
* sequences need rationalisation and sanitisation
* p:try in evalstep ?
* target main eXist scenarios
    - xquery->p:choose->xquery
    - xslt -> xslfo -> pdf
* create namespace module to import all the different namespaces
* statically calculate all system-property (will it always be invariant during processing)


Limitations/Differences
* p:xquery currently outputs a c:result element
* p:compare currently has a primary result port
* declare base-uri affects module imports in saxon (need to investigate in eXist)
* passing required/add-attribute--002.xml test will require namespace handling
* represent sequences as t:document in count-001.xml in testing suite ?
