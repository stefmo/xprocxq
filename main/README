1. Deps

Currently to run unit tests and build stuff, xproc.xq is firmly dependent on Saxon-SA ... yes that is the one you
buy ;).

    Saxon-SA (www.saxonica.com) (NOTE: only support SAXON at the moment)
        (Saxon requires one to compile an extension, using ant build.xml)

I plan to support Saxon-B and eXist (exist.sourceforge.net) and any other XQuery processor 
that has support for first class functions and an eval extension ;)
   
Note: One will also require Apache Ant to unit test and build associated artifacts via the supplied
build.xml file
