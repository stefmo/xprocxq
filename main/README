1. Deps

Currently to run unit tests and build stuff, xproc.xq is firmly dependent on Saxon-SA ... yes that is the one you
buy ;) The plan is to have support for eXist and Saxon-B at some point soon.

    Saxon-SA (www.saxonica.com) (NOTE: only support SAXON at the moment)
        (Saxon requires one to compile something)

    or

    eXist (exist.sourceforge.net)


Note: will also require Apache Ant to unit test and build associated artifacts
