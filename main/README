PREREQUISITES
-------------

To run unit tests and build stuff, xproc.xq is firmly dependent on Saxon-SA ... yes that is the one you
buy ;).

    Saxon-SA (www.saxonica.com) (NOTE: only support SAXON at the moment)
        (Saxon requires you to compile an extension, using supplied build file)

I plan to support Saxon-B and eXist (exist.sourceforge.net) and any other XQuery processor 
that has support for first class functions and an eval extension, though will be focusing on 
Saxon-SA for the time being.
   
Note: Apache Ant is useful for building associated artifacts via the supplied
build.xml file, as well as running unit tests


INSTRUCTIONS
------------

The distribution consists of:

    README      This document.

    VERSION     A summary of the distribution version.

    RELEASE     current release version

    ChangeLog   generated svn changelog

    build.xml   Apache Ant build file For testing and customizing distro

    properties.xml properties used by the Apache Ant build file

    bin/    xproc run script

    etc/    misc artifacts

    lib/    3rd party deps, this directory is empty for the time being

    test/   Xquery Unit Tests & XProc Unit Tests

    src/    XQuery source files

When the distro matures a little bit, you will simply be able to execute a run 
wrapper, under the bin directory.

For now, all one can really do is execute XQuery Unit tests from the Apache Ant build file.


NOTES
-----

xproc.xq is ALPHA software ... its also heavily dependent on SAXON-SA currently. 

It currently implements a very small subset of the XML WG XProc current draft and 
has a few non-standard conventions ... to make things work.
