This is xproc.xq v.5                                      
------------------------------

xproc.xq is an experimental bootstrap implementation of W3C XProc Specification, written in xquery


LICENSE INFORMATION
-------------------

xproc.xq is released under Mozilla Public License (MPL) v1.1, a copy of which is included
in this distribution, under a file named LICENSE.


PREREQUISITES
-------------

To run unit tests and build stuff xproc.xq is dependent on Saxon-SA ... yes that is the one you
buy. I recommend purchasing SAXON (if not just to support the heroic efforts of Michael Kay),
but you will be disappointed if you do so just to run xproc.xq.

   Saxon-SA (www.saxonica.com): required for xproc.xq
   Apache Ant: used to compile extensions

I plan to support Saxon-B and eXist (exist.sourceforge.net) and any other XQuery processor 
that has support for first class functions and an eval extension, though will be focusing on 
Saxon-SA for the time being.
   

INSTALL
-------

1) Check out distro
2) Ensure dependencies are placed in /lib directory
3) amend properties.xml
4) build extensions using Apache Ant
5) amend classpath in bin/xprocxq

NOTES
-----

xproc.xq is ALPHA software and is 100% dependent on SAXON-SA.

As xquery.xq is implemented in XQuery, errors will first start out as an XQuery error.
For example, you will see that errors are reported to originate from util.xqm as this is
where static and dynamic errors are evaluated.
