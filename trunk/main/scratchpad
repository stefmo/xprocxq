ISSUE
----------------------------------------

* p:store uses 

* add primary input to evaluation in u:xquery, instead of passing
to each function
* fix p:choose deal with xpath-context, each subpipeline must have the same output signature (static check)
* need to check eq and = throughout the codebase to ensure we are testing equality properly
* migrate errors from string to QName
* make error reporting look nicer and try to get some semblance of line number reporting correct
* declare-steps needs refactoring in parsing and execution
* inputs in nested p:declare-steps need fixing due to $allcomp in xproc:explicitnames
* namespace fixups: enumerate step level in scope namespaces
* sequences need rationalization and sanitization
* p:try in evalstep ?
* target main eXist scenarios
    - xquery->p:choose->xquery
    - xslt -> xslfo -> pdf
	- form handler
	- the same applies to all apps where a user needs to log in first
	- how about a simple wizard-style example, e.g. along the lines of the "number guessing" example in eXist. I think the page flow logic could all be done in xproc.
	
* create namespace module to manage namespace fixups 
* testsuite represents sequences as t:document in count-001.xml in testing suite ?
* p:xinclude needs a serialize and parse operation




== Roadmap ==

Looks like this for now.

  * release eXist version ('throw it over the wall')
  * implement as many of the standard & optional steps as possible
  * refactor handling of sequences
  * refactor weak typing and preparse routines
  * ensure static and dynamic error checking is working properly
  * create namespace handling module to implement more sophisticated namespace fixup 
  * release SAXON, MarkLogic, and other XQuery processor versions
